Hello, and welcome  to the documentation for ArtBuilder!

This is an HTML5 / JS application, so all you need to run it is open up index.html in a browser.
I used Firefox to develop and test, so you'll get best results with that browser.

This application does use a library "Konva.js" (https://konvajs.org/). The file is grabbed from the latest release so you'll need an internet connection.
Some websites are very mean and won't share their images with mine. If you're trying to add an image and nothing works,
please use some of the attached functioning images:

If something breaks, you can save the canvas code using the share button and load the canvas up again.

If you've got any questions, reach out to me at JWAquilante@wpi.edu.
